# nginx use case

Some examples/tryouts of creating an nginx webserver with:

* certificates based on docker secrets
* docker stacks to have all stuff in 1 definition file
* have an apparmor protected docker container to increase security within the container
* different images (signed ones and non-signed ones) to test signing
